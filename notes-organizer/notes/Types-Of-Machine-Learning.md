# Types of Machine Learning

There are three main types of machine learning based on how the algorithm learns:

## 1. Supervised Learning

The algorithm learns from **labeled data** - data that includes both inputs and the correct outputs.

**How it works:** The algorithm is trained on examples where the correct answer is provided, then learns to predict outcomes for new data.

**Common uses:**
- Classification (e.g., spam detection, image recognition)
- Regression (e.g., price prediction, sales forecasting)

**Examples:** Email spam filters, house price prediction, medical diagnosis

## 2. Unsupervised Learning

The algorithm learns from **unlabeled data** - data without predefined categories or answers.

**How it works:** The algorithm finds hidden patterns, structures, or relationships in the data on its own.

**Common uses:**
- Clustering (grouping similar items)
- Dimensionality reduction
- Association rule learning

**Examples:** Customer segmentation, recommendation systems, anomaly detection

## 3. Reinforcement Learning

The algorithm learns through **trial and error** by receiving rewards or penalties for actions.

**How it works:** An agent interacts with an environment, takes actions, and learns from feedback (rewards/punishments) to maximize long-term rewards.

**Common uses:**
- Game playing
- Robotics
- Autonomous vehicles
- Resource optimization

**Examples:** AlphaGo, self-driving cars, robot navigation, personalized recommendations

## Semi-Supervised Learning (Hybrid)

A combination of supervised and unsupervised learning that uses a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data.

**Use case:** When labeling data is expensive or time-consuming but unlabeled data is abundant.
